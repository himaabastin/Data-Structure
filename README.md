# Data-Structure
***

### Overview 📌
 This JavaScript project implements a custom data structure, enhancing the core capabilities of the language for effective data manipulation.Data structures are the building blocks of software. They define how data is organized, stored, and manipulated in memory. The choice of a data structure has a direct impact on the efficiency and scalability of algorithms and applications.This repository demonstrates a practical example of how to create and use data structures in JavaScript .

### Functionality 👩🏾‍💻
* **Implementation of Data Structure**: We have developed a custom data structure (e.g., stack, queue, linked list, or tree) to showcase how these structures can be built in JavaScript. Our structure is designed to efficiently handle various types of data and operations.

* **Data Manipulation**: The project demonstrates how to add, remove, search, and perform other essential operations on the chosen data structure.

* **Use Cases**: We provide examples and use cases to illustrate how the data structure can be applied in real-world scenarios. These use cases help developers understand the practical utility of the structure.
